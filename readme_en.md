## How to use

### Step 1: Prepare the URL and XPath you want to capture.

Assume the target URL is _ht<span>tp://www<span>.somestock<span>.com/stock1001/_ .

Assume the XPath is _/html/body/main/div/div\[3\]/span\[1\]_ .

### Step 2: Register a free website that supports PHP.

Assume the website is _ht<span>tp://whoAmI<span>.freehost<span>.com/_ .

### Step 3: Download this program. Rename the PHP files for security (Don't tell anyone):

Assume:

_SH\_Write.php -> Help\_W.php_  
_SH\_Read.php -> Help\_R.php_

### Step 4: Upload the PHP files to the free website.

### Step 5: Edit a text file

e.g., _Sample1.TXT_.

The format of this text file is as follows:

Line 1: URL to capture  
Line 2: XPath to capture  
Line 3: ID for future retrieval (choose a unique ID without commas)  
Line 4: Data mode, 0=text, 1=number  
  
Example:

_ht<span>tp://www<span>.somestock<span>.com/stock1001/_  
_/html/body/main/div/div\[3\]/span\[1\]_  
_Example\_1_  
_0_

### Step 6: Edit a batch file

e.g., _Run.BAT_.

**Its content is as follows:**

_sheetHelper.exe Sample1.TXT ht<span>tp://whoAmI<span>.freehost<span>.com/Help_W.php_  
_timeout /t 10_

**For multiple targets:**

_sheetHelper.exe Sample1.TXT ht<span>tp://whoAmI<span>.freehost<span>.com/Help_W.php_  
_sheetHelper.exe Sample2.TXT ht<span>tp://whoAmI<span>.freehost<span>.com/Help_W.php_  
_sheetHelper.exe Sample3.TXT ht<span>tp://whoAmI<span>.freehost<span>.com/Help_W.php_  
_timeout /t 10_

Run the batch file. If it prompts to install the WebView2 runtime component, download it from:

### Step 7: Set up the first column in Google Sheets:

_\=IMPORTXML("ht<span>tp://whoAmI<span>.freehost<span>.com/Help_R.php?id=Example_1","//span[@class='Example_1']")_  
This displays the captured value.

### Step 8: If you need an alert when it stops, set up the second column:

_\=IMPORTXML("ht<span>tp://whoAmI.freehost.com/Help_R.php?id=Example_1","//span[@class='Example_1_sec']")_  
This shows the seconds since the last update. You can perform calculations, e.g., divide by 3600 for hours.

### Step 9: After confirming everything works, use the Task Scheduler to execute Run.BAT based on your desired conditions.

### Step 10: Congratulations! You're done.

### Advanced Usage:

If you have multiple capture targets, set them as â€¦Help\_R.php?id=Example\_1,Example\_2,Example\_3 to save on read operations.

For the stop working alert column, use "Conditional Formatting" to display a specific color when exceeding a certain time.

If data mode is set to 0 (text), it uploads any information. If set to 1 (number), it only uploads when detecting as an number (excluding % symbol) to enhance field change detection.

### Final Reminders:

Google Sheets update frequency is limited (approximately once per hour). Adjust the program's start time accordingly. Set a longer update time to avoid unnecessary traffic waste.

The program may work with Microsoft Excel 2013 and later versions, but testing is required.

The program generates a browsing cache folder in the same directory. You may delete it when the program is not running, but keeping it can speed up webpage loading.
